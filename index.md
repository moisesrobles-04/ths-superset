<h1> This is a site for the Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) Dashboards. </h1>

<p> THS designed to help health officials collect tweets, 
    determine if they are related with a medical condition, 
    extract metadata out of them, and create 
    a big data warehouse that can be used to further analyze said data. 
    The system classify tweets in 3 different categories: 
    related, unrelated, or ambiguous; with a 96% precision, 
    89% recall, and 86% F1 score.</p>

More information will be added in the future.
