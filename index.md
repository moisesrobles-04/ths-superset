This is a site for the Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) Dashboards. The different categories are:

[Users]

[Tweets]

[Hashtags]

The THS designed to help health officials collect tweets, determine if they are related with a medical condition, extract metadata out of them, and create a big data warehouse that can be used to further analyze said data. The system classify tweets in 3 different categories: related, unrelated, or ambiguous; with a 96% precision, 89% recall, and 86% F1 score.

More information will be added in the future.
